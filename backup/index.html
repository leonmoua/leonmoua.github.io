        <h2>My Name Is Leon</h2>
        <p>My name is Leon. I think it's a little late for an introduction this
          far into the semester, but I figured it'd be a perfect opporunity to 
          throw a paragraph into this test website.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <article>
          <p>I like to watch anime and play video games a lot. I also like to draw
            and I have a big passion for it. I hope to one day become an animator 
            or a concept artist for a video game some day, but for now I think becoming
            a web developer is the way to go for a stable career. That's all about me 
            so here's another paragraph with lorem. 
          </p>

            quis laudantium dolorem, rem distinctio labore totam sit a iure, hic

            molestiae perspiciatis.
